    "**Reason:** In the broadcast version, each element of `A` is subtracted from `x`. By the time the last row of `A` is processed, the results of processing the first row have been evicted from the cache, so for the second step these differences are loaded back into the cache and squared. Finally, they are loaded and processed a third time for summation. Since `A` is quite large, parts of the cache are cleared at each step to accommodate all the data.\n",
